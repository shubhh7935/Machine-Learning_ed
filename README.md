# Machine Learning A-Z

Welcome to my **Machine Learning A-Z**! This repository is dedicated to practicing and implementing machine learning concepts from the Udemy course **Machine Learning A-Z**. Below, you'll find details about the repository structure, file naming conventions, and how to use this repository effectively.

---

## Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a personal learning space where I:
- Watch course videos and practice the concepts.
- Create Jupyter notebooks for each unit covered in the course.
- Maintain a structured and organized reference for future use.

---

## Repository Structure
To ensure easy navigation and reference, the repository is organized as follows:
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for each unit.
- **`datasets/`**: Stores datasets used in the exercises.
- **`resources/`**: Additional resources like notes or scripts.

## File Naming Convention
To maintain sequence and clarity, follow this file naming template for Jupyter notebooks:
```
Unit-<Number>_<Topic>.ipynb
```
For example:
- `Unit-01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
- `Unit-02_Regression.ipynb`

---

## How to Use This Repository
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder to access the Jupyter notebooks for each unit.
2. Refer to the `datasets/` folder for any required datasets.
3. Use the `README.md` file for an overview of the repository.

## Syncing Local Folder with GitHub Repository
To check if your local folder is synced with the GitHub repository:
1. Open a terminal in the local repository folder.
2. Run the following commands:

  git fetch
  git status
  ```
  - If you see "Your branch is up to date," your local folder is synced.
  - If there are changes, commit and push them using:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update repository"
    git push
    ```
